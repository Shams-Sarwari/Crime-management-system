Class diagrams are a fundamental visual representation in object-oriented modeling that helps depict the structure and relationships between classes within a system. In the context of the traffic crime management system, class diagrams serve as a valuable tool for understanding and illustrating the classes, their attributes, and the associations between them. This visual representation provides stakeholders, developers, and users with a clear overview of how different classes are organized and how they interact within the system.
